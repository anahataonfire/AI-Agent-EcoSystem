System is NOT General Autonomy because: (a) cannot create new goals, (b) cannot modify skills or beliefs, (c) cannot bypass abort conditions, (d) learning is scoped to strategy only. System is NOT Unbounded because: (a) all learning has caps and decay, (b) determinism is preserved via snapshot isolation, (c) operators retain kill-switch authority.",
